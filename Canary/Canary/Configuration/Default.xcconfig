// The default `CFBundleName` is `$(PRODUCT_NAME)`, and the original `PRODUCT_NAME` is `Canary`.
// Later on, `CFBundleName` should be changed to `MoPub` instead of `Canary`, but we cannot use
// `MoPub` for `PRODUCT_NAME` since this introduces a namespace collision with the MoPub SDK module.
// To solve this namespace collision issue, `PRODUCT_NAME` stays the same as `Canary`, but
// `BUNDLE_NAME` is created and assigned to `CFBundleName` as `$(BUNDLE_NAME)` in the plist files.
BUNDLE_NAME = MoPub
PRODUCT_NAME = Canary
